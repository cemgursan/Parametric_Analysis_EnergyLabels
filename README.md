# Parametric Analysis for Energy Label Calculation

## Overview

This repository contains a parametric analysis implemented in a Jupyter Notebook aimed at calculating energy labels for buildings in the Netherlands. The analysis evaluates various parameters to determine their impact on a building's energy efficiency rating.

The primary objective of this project is to transform this analytical process into an interactive dashboard, providing an intuitive tool for customers to quickly assess and visualize the energy performance of their buildings.

## Project Structure

* `Parametric_Analysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the parametric analysis logic, data processing steps, and visualization examples.

## Features

* **Parametric Analysis**: Systematically explores the impact of different parameters on energy efficiency.
* **Energy Label Calculation**: Implements the energy rating methodology specific to building regulations in the Netherlands.
* **Visualization**: Provides graphical outputs (plots, charts) for a clear understanding of results.

## Requirements

* Python 3.x
* Jupyter Notebook
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Plotly

Install necessary libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib plotly
```

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/energy-label-analysis.git
cd energy-label-analysis
```

### Run the Notebook

Start Jupyter Notebook with the following command:

```bash
jupyter notebook Parametric_Analysis.ipynb
```

Navigate through the notebook cells to execute and view the parametric analysis.

## Future Development

* **Dashboard Development**: Transform this notebook into an interactive dashboard using tools such as Streamlit, Dash, or PowerBI.
* **Enhanced User Experience**: Allow customers to input building parameters and dynamically visualize energy labels.
* **Deployment**: Host the dashboard online for easy customer access.
